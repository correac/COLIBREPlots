Mead et al. (2024) use the SDSS (Blanton et al. 2017) APOGEE survey (Majewski et al. 2017) DR17 (Abdurro’uf et al. 2022) to study the intrinsic abundance scatter of metal-poor ([Fe/H] ≤ -1) stars in dwarf galaxies surrounding the Milky Way.

They implement a metallicity cut of −2.1 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ −1 to obtain the metal-poor stars whose scatter we are interested in. For all but the halo stars, Mead et al. identify likely members of each system using the assigned APOGEE MEMBERFLAG. Halo stars are identified as metal-poor stars with distance d ≤ 2500pc. These stars are from the solar neighbourhood, but due to their low-metallicity, are likely halo stars.

They use chemical abundances derived by ASPCAP for the stars in our sample (García Pérez et al. 2016).
